  Objective: Select a subset of parties such that the total is >= 175. 

  We also include the constraints that some parties don't want 
  to accept a coalition including certain parties, i.e. v and sd.
  Note: in the original setting (in 2018) L stated that they 
        don't support a SD coalition. But much have changed in 2021:
        now L accept SD (and would not vote no to SD).

  Here are the 23 possible coalitions with >= 175 votes, with the no accept 
  constraints for v and sd (in go/0):

  The second scenario is the it's more realistic that S would vote
  against a coalition with SD so then we have these 16 coalitions:

     num_coalitions = 16
     With v/sd no vote constraints: Adding S is against SD.

  One can note that in all both these scenarious, s must not vote against
  the coalition.


  The third scenariou is with no constraints at all, with give 128 possible 
  (and probably some impossible) coalitions (go3/0).

    Without v/sd no vote constraints
    num_coalitions = 128
