  Puzzle #223 from Dudeney "536 Puzzles and curious problems":
  """
  The driver of the taxi was wanting in civility, so Mr. Wilkins asked him for his 
  number. "You want my number, do you?" said the driver. "Well, work it out for yourself.
  If you divide my number by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 you will find there is always 1 over; but if
  you divide it by 11 there is no remainder. Whatâ€™s more, there is no other driver with
  a lower number who can say the same." What was the fellowâ€™s number? 
  """
