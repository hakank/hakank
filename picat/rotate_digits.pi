  Rotate digits puzzle in Picat.

  Puzzle #60 from Clessa "Math and logic puzzles for PC enthusiasts":
  """
  In the grid shown, the digits 1â€“9 are arranged so that the first row added to the second
  row equals the bottom row (i.e. 583 + 146 = 729). Now if the grid is rotated clockwise
  at 90 degrees, you will see that the first two rows still add up to the last row (i.e. 
  715 + 248 = 963). Can you find another combination of the digits 1â€“9 which has the same
  property?

     5 8 3     7 1 5
     1 4 6     2 4 8
     7 2 9     9 6 3
  """

  The two solutions are
   {4,8,2}
   {1,5,7}
   {6,3,9}

   {5,8,3}
   {1,4,6}
   {7,2,9}
