  ...
  Also called the involution numbers, they can be determined by the recurrence:

      a_0 = a_1 = 1;
      a_n = a_{n−1} + (n − 1) a_{n−2}, for n > 1.

  More interesting, they also count the number of involutions on a set
  with n elements -- note that an involutary function, is a function f 
  that is its own inverse, that is,

     f(f(x)) = x for all x in the domain of f. 
  """
  
  The sequence is
  1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, 35696, 140152, ...
  "Number of self-inverse permutations on n letters, also known as 
   involutions; number of Young tableaux with n cells.":
