  Horner's rule in Picat.

  From http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Horner%27s_rule_for_polynomial_evaluation#K
  """
  A fast scheme for evaluating a polynomial such as:

    -19+7x-4x^2+6x^3\, 

  when

    x = 3 

   is to arrange the computation as follows:

    ((((0) x + 6) x + (-4)) x + 7) x + (-19); 

  And compute the result from the innermost brackets outwards as in this pseudocode:

     coefficients := [-19, 7, -4, 6] # list coefficients of all x^0..x^n in order
     x := 3
     accumulator := 0
     for i in length(coefficients) downto 1 do
       # Assumes 1-based indexing for arrays
       accumulator := ( accumulator * x ) + coefficients[i]
     done
     # accumulator now has the answer

   Task Description

  Create a routine that takes a list of coefficients of a polynomial in order 
  of increasing powers of x; together with a value of x to compute its value at, 
  and return the value of the polynomial at that value using Horner's rule.
