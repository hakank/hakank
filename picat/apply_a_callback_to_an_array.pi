/* 

  Apply a callback to an array in Picat.

  From Rosetta Code:
  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Apply_a_callback_to_an_array
  """
  In this task, the goal is to take a combined set of elements and apply a function to each element.
  """

  Note: As of writing (Picat version alpha 0.1), don't support anonymous (lambda) functions
  so the function must be defined in the program.

  This Picat model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand, hakank@gmail.com
