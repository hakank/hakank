  """
  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

     A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting 
     with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of 
     the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the 
     number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly 
     in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which 
     this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do 
     not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of 
     your output here. 

  Task: Find and print the first 8 happy numbers.
