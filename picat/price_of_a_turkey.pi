  Price of a turkey in Picat.

  """
  A butcher received an invoice for a consignment of 72 turkeys, but unfortunately 
  it was smudged and a couple of figures were unreadable. All he could read was 
  â€™?67.9?â€™, with the first and last figures illegible. Nevertheless, being a "puzzler", 
  he was able to work out the price of a turkey immediately. What was the price of 
  one turkey? (see [1]).

  Solution: 

  turkey = 511
  total = 367.92 = [3,6,7,9,2]
