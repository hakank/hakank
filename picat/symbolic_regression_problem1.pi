  Not sure if this is the correct section but I'll give it a shot. I'm 
  looking for numeric sequence prediction program. Say if I input a 
  set of   or #s say three times and see if it can find a pattern on 
  the next #. 
  say if I input

  first input 3 0 0 4 2 9 6
  second input 4 1 1 5 3 0 7
  third input 5 2 2 6 4 1 8

  Now if you're looking at the above   you would notice that I add one 
  to each   every round. I need a program that can find patterns like that 
  and predict the next #. Basically a program that can think and uses a 
  gizillion methods to see if there is a trend/pattern and try to come 
  up with the next set of #s. Is there such program and can I acquire 
  it for use.

  Or a second example would be something like this:
  First set will be a+b+c = D
  second set (D+a)+(D+b)+(D+c) = D
  third set will be the same as second set because it just repeats the 
  same process so a,b,c would be what I would inpute and D would 
  total +a,b,c and so on.
  
  Is there such program? Also if i'm not clear on anything please let me know.
