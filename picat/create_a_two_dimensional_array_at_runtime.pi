  Create a two-dimensional array at runtime in Picat.

  """
  Get two integers from the user, then create a two-dimensional array where 
  the two dimensions have the sizes given by those numbers, and which can 
  be accessed in the most natural way possible. Write some element of that 
  array, and then output that element. Finally destroy the array if not done 
  by the language itself.
