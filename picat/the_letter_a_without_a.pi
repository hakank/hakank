  The Letter A without A

  Your task is to display the letter "A" alone, without anything else, except any form 
  of trailing newlines if you cannot avoid them, doing so in a program and/or snippet. Code 
  that returns (instead of printing) is allowed.

  Both the lowercase and uppercase versions of the letter "A" are acceptable (that is, unicode 
  U+0061 or unicode U+0041. Other character encodings that aren't Unicode are allowed, 
  but either way, the resulting output of your code must be the latin letter "A", and not 
  any lookalikes or homoglyphs)

  You must not use any of the below characters in your code, regardless of the character 
  encoding that you pick:

  "A", whether uppercase or lowercase.
  "U", whether lowercase or uppercase.
  X, whether uppercase or lowercase.
  +
  &
  #
  0
  1
  4
  5
  6
  7
  9

  Cheating, loopholes, etc, are not allowed.

  Since this is code-golf, the shortest solution, in bytes, that follows all the rules, is the winner.

  Allowed numbers are 2,3,8
