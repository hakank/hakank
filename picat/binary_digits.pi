  Binary digits (Rosetta code) in Picat.

  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Binary_digits
  """
  Create and display the sequence of binary digits for a given   non-negative integer.

   The decimal value      5   should produce an output of               101
   The decimal value     50   should produce an output of            110010
   The decimal value   9000   should produce an output of    10001100101000

   The results can be achieved using built-in radix functions within the language 
   (if these are available), or alternatively a user defined function can be used.

   The output produced should consist just of the binary digits of each number followed 
   by a   newline.

   There should be no other whitespace, radix or sign markers in the produced output, and leading 
   zeros should not appear in the results.
