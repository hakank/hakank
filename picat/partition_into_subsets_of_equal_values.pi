  Partitioning set into subsets with respect to equality of sum among subsets
  """
  let say i have {3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1,5,2,7} set of numbers, I need to split the 
  numbers such that sum of subset1 should be equal to sum of subset2 
  {3,2,7} {1,1,2,1,5,2}. First we should identify whether we can split number(one 
  way might be dividable by 2 without any remainder) and if we can, we should 
  write our algorithm two create s1 and s2 out of s.
  
  How to proceed with this approach? I read partition problem in wiki and even in some 
  articles but i am not able to get anything. Can someone help me to find the 
  right algorithm and its explanation in simple English?
