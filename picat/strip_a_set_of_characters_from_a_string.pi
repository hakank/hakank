  Strip a set of characters from a string Picat.

  From Rosetta code:
  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Strip_a_set_of_characters_from_a_string
  """
  The task is to create a function that strips a set of characters 
  from a string. The function should take two arguments: the first argument 
  being a string to stripped and the second, a string containing the set 
  of characters to be stripped. The returned string should contain the 
  first string, stripped of any characters in the second argument:

     print stripchars("She was a soul stripper. She took my heart!","aei")
     Sh ws  soul strppr. Sh took my hrt!
