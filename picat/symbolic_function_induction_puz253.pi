  Encoded as 
      E  _   A
      _  B   _ 
      C _    D

  These solutions are probably not correct since all values are not used:
  maxCount = 3
  code = ((C - B) - A) = [[[4,2,11,4],5],[[1,5,13,3],7]] = [[4,4,20,4] = 12]
  code = (B + (D - 1)) = [[[4,2,11,4],5],[[1,5,13,3],7]] = [[4,4,20,4] = 7]


  Adding the "use_all_variables" flag gives this solution:
  code = ((B * (A + D)) - C) = [[[4,2,11,4],5],[[1,5,13,3],7]] = [[4,4,20,4] = 12]


  The intended solution:
  """
  Answer  :   12
  In each box, sum of numbers in first column divided by sum of numbers in third column 
  gives middle number in second column.

  (5+11)   รท   (4+4)   =  2
  (7+13)   รท   (1+3)   =  5
  (20+12)  รท   (4+4)   =  4

  So, answer is 12.
