  Determine whether strings are anagrams

  Challenge
  Given two strings, work out if they both have exactly the same characters in them.

  Example
  Input

  word, wrdo

  This returns true because they are the same but just scrambled.

  Input

  word, wwro

  This returns false.

  Input

  boat, toba

  This returns true

  Rules
  Here are the rules!

  Assume input will be at least 1 char long, and no longer than 8 chars.
  No special characters, only aâ€“z
  All inputs can be assumed to be lowercase

  Test Cases
  boat, boat = true
  toab, boat = true
  oabt, toab = true
  a, aa = false
  zzz, zzzzzzzz = false
  zyyyzzzz, yyzzzzzy = true
  sleepy, pyels = false
  p,p = true
