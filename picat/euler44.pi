  Euler #44 in Picat.

  """  
  Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P(n)=n(3n−1)/2. 
  The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

  1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

  It can be seen that P(4) + P(7) = 22 + 70 = 92 = P(8). However, 
  their difference,  70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

  Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P(j) and P(k), for which their sum 
  and difference is pentagonal and D = |P(k) − P(j)| is minimised; what 
  is the value of D?
