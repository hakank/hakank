  Strip whitespace from a string/Top and tail (Rosetta code) in Picat.

  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Strip_whitespace_from_a_string/Top_and_tail
  """
  The task is to demonstrate how to strip leading and trailing whitespace from a 
  string. The solution should demonstrate how to achieve the following three results:

    - String with leading whitespace removed
    - String with trailing whitespace removed
    - String with both leading and trailing whitespace removed 

  For the purposes of this task whitespace includes non printable characters such as the 
  space character, the tab character, and other such characters that have no corresponding 
  graphical representation.
