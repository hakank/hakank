  McNuggets Problem (Rosetta Code) in Picat.

  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/McNuggets_Problem#MiniZinc
  """
  From Wikipedia:
  '''
  The McNuggets version of the coin problem was introduced by Henri Picciotto,
  who included it in his algebra textbook co-authored with Anita Wah. Picciotto
  thought of the application in the 1980s while dining with his son at
  McDonald's, working the problem out on a napkin. A McNugget number is
  the total number of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets in any number of boxes.
  In the United Kingdom, the original boxes (prior to the introduction of
  the Happy Meal-sized nugget boxes) were of 6, 9, and 20 nuggets.
  '''

  Task

  Calculate (from 0 up to a limit of 100) the largest non-McNuggets number (a number n 
  which cannot be expressed with 6x + 9y + 20z = n where x, y and z are natural numbers).
