/* 

  N water jugs model in Picat.

  This is a generalization of water_jugs.pi and water_jugs2.pi 
  and is taken from a_stolen_balsam.pi

  Compared to the traditional 2 jugs problem, this model can take
  any number of jugs, not just 2.

  It comes with some costs:
  - it can be a little slower for 2 jugs problems than the dedicated
    2 jugs solver in water_jugs2.pi
  - it requires an extra jug that represents the "infinite"
    amount of water (though it must have some integer value) as well
    as a "ground" jug to which water can be poured to the "ground".

  This version can also model the variant of water jug problem that 
  is represented in a_stolen_balsam.pi in which there are an exact
  amount of water to distribute.

  This program was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand, hakank@gmail.com

  Here is a way to encode a standard 3 jugs puzzle.
  Note that there must be an extra jug for an endless supply of water 
  and for emptying a jug. This is the first vessel/jug in the 
  lists (here with a capacity of 20).

  This is the Die Hard version:
  Jugs are of sizes 5L and 3L and the object is to measure 4L, i.e
    [5,3] -> [4,0].

  This is the unique solution:

  Plan:
  Pour  5 liter from the 20 vessel to the  5 vessel: [15,5,0]
  Pour  3 liter from the  5 vessel to the  3 vessel: [15,2,3]
  Pour  3 liter from the  3 vessel to the 20 vessel: [18,2,0]
  Pour  2 liter from the  5 vessel to the  3 vessel: [18,0,2]
  Pour  5 liter from the 20 vessel to the  5 vessel: [13,5,2]
  Pour  1 liter from the  5 vessel to the  3 vessel: [13,4,3]
  Pour  3 liter from the  3 vessel to the 20 vessel: [16,4,0]

  Here is a (perhaps contrieved) variant of the stolen balsam puzzle:

  6 thieves stole 60L of balsam and want to divide it 
  so the first three thieves get the same amount and the 
  last three thieves get the same amount.

  They bought vessels of sizes 30L, 25L, 19L, 11L, 9L, and 7L.

  How should the thieves divide the loot?

  shown by changing 
    Cost = 1 
  to 
    Cost = -1
  in action/4.

  (Don't forget to change Cost back.)

  Another - and perhaps simpler - way is to use plan/3 instead.
