  ABC problem in Picat v3.

  From 
  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/ABC_Problem
  """
  You are given a collection of ABC blocks. Just like the ones you had when you were a kid. 
  There are twenty blocks with two letters on each block. You are guaranteed to have a complete alphabet 
  amongst all sides of the blocks. The sample blocks are:

    ((B O) 
    (X K) 
    (D Q) 
    (C P) 
    (N A) 
    (G T) 
    (R E) 
    (T G) 
    (Q D) 
    (F S) 
    (J W) 
    (H U) 
    (V I) 
    (A N) 
    (O B) 
    (E R) 
    (F S) 
    (L Y) 
    (P C) 
    (Z M)) 

   The goal of this task is to write a function that takes a string and can determine whether 
   you can spell the word with the given collection of blocks. The rules are simple:

   Once a letter on a block is used that block cannot be used again
   The function should be case-insensitive
   Show your output on this page for the following words: 

   Example

 
    >>> can_make_word("A")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("BARK")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("BOOK")
    False
    >>> can_make_word("TREAT")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("COMMON")
    False
    >>> can_make_word("SQUAD")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("CONFUSE")
    True
