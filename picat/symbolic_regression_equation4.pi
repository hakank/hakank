  If 4 + 2 = 26, 8 + 1 = 79, 6 + 5 = 111, then what is 7 + 3 = ?
  """

  I.e.
   4 + 2 = 26
   8 + 1 = 79
   6 + 5 = 111
   7 + 3 = ?

  The "natural" solution is 410, but it's no found by this program:
  4-2 = 2, 4+2 = 6 -> 26
  8-1 = 7, 8+1 = 9 -> 79
  6-5 = 1, 6+5 = 11 -> 1 11 -> 111
  7-3 = 4, 7+3 = 10 -> 4 10 -> 410

  
  Note that the trick with "truncated unknown" that works with 
  symbolic_function_induction.pi does not work with symbolic_regression.pi.
