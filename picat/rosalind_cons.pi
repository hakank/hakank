  Problem
  A matrix is a rectangular table of values divided into rows and columns. An mÃ—n matrix has m rows 
  and n columns. Given a matrix A, we write Ai,j to indicate the value found at the intersection 
  of row i and column j.

  Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length n. Their profile matrix 
  is a 4Ã—n matrix P in which P1,j represents the number of times that 'A' occurs in the jth position 
  of one of the strings, P2,j represents the number of times that C occurs in the jth position, 
  and so on (see below).

  A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection by taking the most common 
  symbol at each position; the jth symbol of c therefore corresponds to the symbol having the maximum 
  value in the j-th column of the profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol, 
  leading to multiple possible consensus strings.

  DNA Strings
  A T C C A G C T
  G G G C A A C T
  A T G G A T C T
  A A G C A A C C
  T T G G A A C T
  A T G C C A T T
  A T G G C A C T

  Profile	
  A   5 1 0 0 5 5 0 0
  C   0 0 1 4 2 0 6 1
  G   1 1 6 3 0 1 0 0
  T   1 5 0 0 0 1 1 6

  Consensus	
      A T G C A A C T

  Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1 kbp) in FASTA format.

  Return: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If several possible consensus strings 
  exist, then you may return any one of them.)
