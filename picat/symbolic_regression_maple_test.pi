  I am trying to fit  this function with some data
  F:= M*(  (1 -  ( 1 - a)*e^(-k*q*t)) /q)^(1/(1-q)) ;
  where a:= (No/M)^(1-q). I need to know the values
  of k, q and M, I do have No (initial condition)

  ...
  
  I did try to do this but it does not work
  with(Optimization):
  f:= x -> M*(  (1 -  ( 1 - q*(0.0012/M)^(1-q))*exp(-k*q*t)) /q)^(1/(1-q)) :
   
  residuals := map(p -> (f(p[1])-p[2]), DATA):
  R:= LSSolve(residuals);
  Error, (in Optimization:-LSSolve) complex value encountered
  
  Please let me know How can I solve  this problem.
