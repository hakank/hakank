  Global constraint sum_ctr in Picat.

  From Global Constraint Catalogue:
  http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat/Csum_ctr.html
  """

  sum_ctr(VARIABLES, CTR, VAR)
  
  Constraint the sum of a set of domain variables. More precisely, let S denote the sum of the 
  variables of the VARIABLES collection. Enforce the following constraint to hold: S CTR VAR.
  
  [CTR are: [=, !=, <, >=, > , <=]
  
  Example
   (<1, 1,4>, =, 6)
  
  The sum_ctr constraint holds since the condition 1+1+4=6 is satisfied.
