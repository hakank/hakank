  Here, you have three sets of numbers arranged in a cross-like pattern. Each set has 
  a central number surrounded by four numbers. You have to find the missing number in 
  the third set by identifying the hidden pattern in the first two sets.

  AllGood:
  [program = (A + D) / (B + C),res = 4.0,count = 951]
  [program = (D + A) / (B + C),res = 4.0,count = 893]
  [program = (D + A) / (C + B),res = 4.0,count = 872]
  [program = (A + D) / (C + B),res = 4.0,count = 867]

  resultMap = [4.0 = 4]


  However, there are some other solutions (without that assumption):

  [program = B - C,res = -1,count = 1830]

  [program = C + B + (C - C - (D - C)),res = -2,count = 1]
