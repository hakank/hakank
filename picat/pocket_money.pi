  Puzzle 6. Pocket money

  "When I got to the station this morning," said Harold Tompkins, at his club, "I found
  I was short of cash. I spent just one-half of what I had on my railway ticket, and then
  bought a nickelâ€™s worth of candy. When I got to the terminus I spent half of what I had
  left and ten cents for a newspaper. Then I spent half of the remainder on a bus ticket
  and gave fifteen cents to that old beggar outside the club. Consequently, I arrive here
  with this single nickel. How much did I start out with?" (puzzle 17 from Dudeney
  2016)
  """

  (A nickel is 5 cent.)
