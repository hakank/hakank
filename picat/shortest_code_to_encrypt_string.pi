  Shortest code to encrypt string in Picat.

  http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/20021/shortest-code-to-encrypt-a-string
  """
  Using a language of your choice write a program that takes a string as an input, 
  and returns the string encrypted.

  Algorithm:
  
  You should assume that each character is always encoded in a byte and is ASCII-based. 
  The extended ASCII codes are mapped to whatever is the default code page in use 
  by the system.
  
  You should encrypt the code in the following way: code of first character +1, code of second 
  character +2, code of third character +3 .....
  
  Extended ASCII codes are based on this table: http://www.asciitable.com/
  
  Shortest code wins.
