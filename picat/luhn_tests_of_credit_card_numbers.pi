  Luhn tests of credit card numbers in Picat.

  From http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Luhn_test_of_credit_card_numbers
  """
  The Luhn test is used by some credit card companies to distinguish 
  valid credit card numbers from what could be a random selection of digits.

  Those companies using credit card numbers that can be validated by the 
  Luhn test have numbers that pass the following test:

   1. Reverse the order of the digits in the number.
   2. Take the first, third, ... and every other odd digit in the 
      reversed digits and sum them to form the partial sum s1
   3. Taking the second, fourth ... and every other even digit in the 
      reversed digits: 

         1. Multiply each digit by two and sum the digits if the answer 
            is greater than nine to form partial sums for the even digits
         2. Sum the partial sums of the even digits to form s2 

     1. If s1 + s2 ends in zero then the original number is in the form 
        of a valid credit card number as verified by the Luhn test. 

  For example, if the trail number is 49927398716:

  Reverse the digits:
    61789372994
  Sum the odd digits:
    6 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 42 = s1
  The even digits:
      1,  8,  3,  2,  9
    Two times each even digit:
      2, 16,  6,  4, 18
    Sum the digits of each multiplication:
      2,  7,  6,  4,  9
    Sum the last:
      2 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 9 = 28 = s2

   s1 + s2 = 70 which ends in zero which means that 49927398716 
  passes the Luhn test

  The task is to write a function/method/procedure/subroutine that will 
  validate a number with the Luhn test, and use it to validate the 
  following numbers:

      49927398716 
      49927398717 
      1234567812345678 
      1234567812345670
