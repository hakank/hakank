  Six-stamp sheet problem (Enigma #312) in Picat.

  """
  From New Scientist #1460, 13th June 1985 [link]
  Enigma 312
        [
          1  2  2
          4  5  8
        ]

  They are now printing stamp-books with stamps of different values on the same sheet. 
  Let us take this a stage further, and design a sheet of 3 × 2 stamps, so that you can 
  make up a postage of any whole number of pence from 1 up to N by tearing out 
  a connected set of one or more stamps.

  'Connected' means edge-connected, not just corner-touching, so that, for instance, the sheet 
  illustrated achieves only N=5, since neither 4+2 nor 5+1 is a connected set, 
  and so 6 is impossible.

  Make a sketch showing how to make N as big as possible, and state what N is.
