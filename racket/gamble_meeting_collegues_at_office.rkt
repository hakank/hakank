  Probably of two colleagues being in the office on the same days

  If two different colleagues independently chose 3 days to go into an office
  Whats the probability that At least 1 match at least 2 match At least 3 match
  1 is 100% as no matter what you will have 1 matching day but beyond that 
  Iâ€™m slightly stumped
