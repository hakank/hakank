  Book sorting puzzle in Racket/Gamble

  """
  Imagine youâ€™re working at a library sorting books. You start with 32 fiction books 
  and 17 non-fiction books in a box. Each turn, you randomly pick two books from 
  the box and remove them.

  You do one more operation based on what books you picked.
  * If the books are of the same type (both fiction or both non-fiction), 
    you add a new fiction book to the box.

  * If the books are of different types (one fiction and one non-fiction), 
    you add a new non-fiction book to the box.

  * You have an unlimited supply of fiction and non-fiction books for this process.

  What will be the type of the last book remaining in the box?
  """

  * 32 fiction, 17 non-fiction
  variable : res
  (n): 1.0

  I.e. the last book will be a non fiction book

  * 32 fiction, 18 non-fiction
  variable : res
  (f): 1 (1.0)

  I.e. the last book will be a fiction book

  More generally: If the number of non-fiction books is odd then the 
  last book will be a non-fiction book. If the number of non-fiction 
  books is even, then it's a fiction book.
