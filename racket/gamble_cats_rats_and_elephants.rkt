  Cats, rats, and elephants in Racket Gamble.

  "Cats and rats and elephants"
  https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/12/11/cats-and-rats-and-elephants/
  """
  A few weeks ago I posted 'Lions and Tigers and Bears', 
  (https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/12/03/lions-and-tigers-and-bears/)
  which poses a Bayesian problem related to the Dirichlet distribution.  If you have 
  not read it, you might want to start there.

  Now hereâ€™s the follow-up question:

    Suppose there are six species that might be in a zoo: lions and tigers and bears, 
    and cats and rats and elephants. Every zoo has a subset of these species, and every 
    subset is equally likely.

    One day we visit a zoo and see 3 lions, 2 tigers, and one bear. Assuming that every 
    animal in the zoo has an equal chance to be seen, what is the probability that the 
    next animal we see is an elephant?
  """

  Note: The approach in this model is the same as in the
  "Lions and Tigers and Bears" problem, just added
    - the three new animals
    - queries which calculates subsets and number of different animals

  With observe/fail this is extremely slow. Using observe-sample and normal-dist is much 
  faster and also fairly accurate. Here's the output for 10000 sample (importance-sampler):
