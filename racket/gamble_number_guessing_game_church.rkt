  Guessing game (Church) in Racket Gamble.

  Here is a direct port of the Church model http://forestdb.org/models/nested-guessing.html
  """
  Two agents play a game in which each agent needs to name a number between 0 and 9 and they 
  win if their numbers add up to 13. The first player knows this, and he knows that the second 
  player gets to see the number the first player chooses, but the second player mistakenly thinks 
  that the two win if their numbers add up to any number greater than 8 (and the first player knows 
  this as well). What number should the first player choose?

  (define (sample)
  (rejection-query
   (define a (sample-integer 10))
   (define b
     (rejection-query
      (define c (sample-integer 10))
      c
      (> (+ a c) 8)))
   a
   (= (+ a b) 13)))

  (hist (repeat 10000 sample))
