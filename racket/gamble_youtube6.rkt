  Racket Gamble.

  This is a port of my PSI model youtube6.wppl 
  (from a now unavailable YouTube video) 
  """
  def main() {
    x := uniform(0,1);
    y := uniform(0,1);
    // z := y - 2*x; // ùîº[x] = 1/4
    // cobserve(z,0);   
    z := y/x;  // ùîº[x] = 1/4
    cobserve(z,2);
  
    return  x;
  }
  """

  The (exact) expected value from PSI is E[x] = 1/3 (0.3333)


  I don't know how to use observe-sample on z. However, using the
  (abs) trick in observe/fail give the (approximately) correct result: 0.333

  var : x
  mean: 0.33082838209469373

  var : z
  mean: 1.9996253950120586

  var : y
  mean: 0.66152383276796
