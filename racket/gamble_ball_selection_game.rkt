  """
  Friends, Tim and David, are playing a game at a party. 
  Box C contains 3 red balls and 4 black balls, while 
  Box D contains 4 red balls and 3 back balls.
  The ball in boxes A [C!] amd B [D!] are identical in all
  respects, except for their color.
  Tim takes a ball at random from Box C and puts it into
  Box D. Then, David takes a ball at random from Box D.

  Q1) What is the probability that the ball taken out of Box D
      by David is black?
  Q2) What is the probability that the ball taken out of Box C 
      by Tim is black, given that the ball taken out of Box D
      by David is red?
  
  """
  Q1) What is the probability that the ball taken out of Box D
      by David is black?

     variable : draw1
     black: 4/7 (0.5714285714285714)
     red: 3/7 (0.42857142857142855)

     variable : draw2
     red: 31/56 (0.5535714285714286)
     black: 25/56 (0.44642857142857145)

     Answer: 25/56

  Q2) What is the probability that the ball taken out of Box C 
      by Tim is black, given that the ball taken out of Box D
      by David is red?

      variable : draw1
      black: 16/31 (0.5161290322580645)
      red: 15/31 (0.4838709677419355)

      variable : draw2
      red: 1 (1.0)

      Answer: 16/31
