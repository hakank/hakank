  Librarian or Farmer problem in Racket.Gamble 

  From Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers, page 7ff
  """
  Consider the following story, inspired by Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
  (2011).  Steve is described as a shy individual, very helpful, but he has little interest in
  other people. He likes things in their proper order, and is very detailed about his work. Do
  you think Steve is more likely to be a librarian or a farmer? It may seem that Steve is more
  likely to be a librarian, and most people would agree with this conclusion, but thatâ€™s
  ignoring the background distribution of librarians and farmers: The ratio of male farmers
  to male librarians is 20:1. Steve is statistically more likely to be a farmer!

  (In the online version of the book, this example seems to have been replaced 
  with a problem of finding bugs in a program.)
