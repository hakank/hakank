  """
  I got this simple puzzle from a dissertation [https://openscholar.uga.edu/record/17924/files/molnar_robert_a_201508_phd.pdf] 
  on teaching conditional probability in a high school context.

  Lucky Dip Task
  Dominic has devised a simple game. Inside a bag he places 3 black and 3 white balls. 
  He then shakes the bag.
  He asks Amy to take two balls from the bag without looking.

  If the two balls are the same color, then Amy wins.
  If they are different colors, then Dominic wins.

  Is the game fair, meaning Dominic and Amy have equal probability if winning?
  If not, then who is most likely to win?
  """

  The game is not fair: 
  Dominic has 3/5 probability of winning, while Amy only has 2/5 probability.

  variable : amy_wins
  #f: 3/5 (0.6)
  #t: 2/5 (0.4)
  mean: 2/5 (0.4)

  variable : dominic-wins
  #t: 3/5 (0.6)
  #f: 2/5 (0.4)
  mean: 3/5 (0.6)

  What if Amy draw _with_ replacement? Then it's a fair game:

  #f: 1/2 (0.5)
  #t: 1/2 (0.5)
  mean: 1/2 (0.5)

  variable : dominic-wins
  #f: 1/2 (0.5)
  #t: 1/2 (0.5)
  mean: 1/2 (0.5)
