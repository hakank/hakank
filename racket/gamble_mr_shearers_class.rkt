  Mr Shearer's class in Racket/Gamble 

  https://minerva-demo.github.io/#category=Probability&index=2
  """
  Question
  Three-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair and six-sevenths 
  of his students are right-handed. If Mr. Shearer's class has 28 students, what is the 
  smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair?
  ...
  Reference answer
  Mr. Shearer has 3/4(28)=21 students with brown hair and 6/7(28)=24 students who are 
  right-handed. Since there are 28âˆ’24=4 left-handed students, at most 4 of the 
  21 brown-haired students are left-handed. Therefore, at least 17 of them are 
  right-handed. Final Answer: The final answer is 17.

  This is a port of my WebPPL model mr_shearers_class.wppl.  
  However, the WebPPL model uses factor to minimize the value (num-both) 
  directly in the model. This feature is not supported in Gamble, so 
  we have to do an external check for this.
