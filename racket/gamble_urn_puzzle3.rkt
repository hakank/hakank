  Puzzle 1

  You have 100 urns, each contain 99 ball. In 99 of the urns, one ball is red,
  and the rest are green. In the last, all 99 balls are red. You pick an urn 
  at random and draw a ball. It's red. Now throw it away. 
  The next ball you draw from the SAME urn is probably 
  * Red
  * Green
  * Equally likely

  It's equally likely that ball2 is red or green.

  var : urn
  99: 1/2 (0.5)
  0: 1/198 (0.005050505050505051)

  98: 1/198 (0.005050505050505051)
  mean: 74 (74.0)

  var : ball2
  green: 1/2 (0.5)
  red: 1/2 (0.5)

  Also, note that it's even chance that we drew from the last (100'th) urn with 
  the 99 red balls.
