  Pesticides in Racket/Gamble

  """
  Hereâ€™s a more complicated example using resampling to perform a hypothesis test. The example
  is taken from Statistics the Easy Way by Douglas Downing and Jeffrey Clark, (Chapter 18
  exercise 5, page 223). Suppose four new pesticides are being tested in a laboratory, with the
  results shown in the following table, called a contingency table. Is pesticide 1 significantly 
  better than the rest?
                    Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 Type 4 Total
  Insects killed     139   100     73     98     410
  Insects surviving   15    50     80     47     192
  Total tested       154   150    153    145     602
  ...
  The result of this simulation is:
  probability: 0.0
  Out of 1000 trials from the null population there were no cases as extreme as the observed
  difference between ratios. Since that is well below our critical value (0.05), you can reject the
  null hypothesis.
