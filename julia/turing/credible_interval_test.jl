   Test of credible interval in Turing.jl

   This is a port of the WebPPL model in

   """
   A simple generative process
   Imagine we are investigating the origins of prosocial behavior: Some scientists believe humans are 
   born with a self-interested tendency and only acquire prosociality through instruction (perhaps mediated 
   by language). Others believe altruism in innate; as soon as children are physically and cognitively 
   able to help, they will. To investigate this, we are going to put pre-verbal infants in a context where 
   a person is struggling to complete their goal (e.g., as in this classic study 
   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfGAen6QiUE Toddler Altruism]).

   We plan to conduct this experiment on 20 infants. Each child may or may not help; what we are interested 
   in is the populationâ€™s propensity to help. A simple generative model of this task would be that infants' 
   propensity to help is like the bias of a coin, and whether or not they help in the moment is the 
   result of flipping that coin.
