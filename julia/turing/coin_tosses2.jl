  Coin tosses

  Coin tosses

  Consider a process where you repeatedly toss coins and record the results.

  After each toss, you continue tossing with probability 0.8.

  Write a predicate tosses(Coin,L) that, given an initial coin id Coin, returns in L the list of
  results of coin tosses obtained using the process above.

  Moreover, write a predicate length_tosses(N) that returns the number of coin tosses.

  Compute the probability of the sequence [h,h,h] using MCINTYRE.

  Compute the probability of the sequence [h,h,h,h,h] given that the subsequence [h,h,h] was observed
  using rejection sampling and Metropolis Hastings.

  Compute the probability of the sequences of 10 coin tosses using MCINTYRE.

  Compute the expected length of the sequences of coin tosses using MCINTYRE.

  Note: The cplint version (corrected by  Fabrizio Riguzzi) at http://cplint.eu/p/coin_tosses_hakank_rzf.swinb
  give another solutions:
   - first problem: probability of the sequence [h,h,h] -> 0.015
   - second problem: probability of the sequence [h,h,h,h,h] given that the subsequence [h,h,h] -> about 0.03
   - third problem: probability of the sequences of 10 coin tosses -> about 0.026
   - fourth problem: expected length of the sequences of coin tosses -> about 4.
