  All interval problem in Julia ConstraintSolver.jl

  CSPLib problem number 7
  http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ianm/CSPLib/prob/prob007/index.html
  """
  Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c , d, ...), represented by
  numbers 0,1,...,11, find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly
  once and in which the musical intervals between neighbouring notes cover
  the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major
  seventh (11 semitones). That is, for each of the intervals, there is a
  pair of neigbhouring pitch-classes in the series, between which this
  interval appears. The problem of finding such a series can be easily
  formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem on Z_n,
  the set of integer residues modulo n. Given n in N, find a vector
  s = (s_1, ..., s_n), such that (i) s is a permutation of
  Z_n = {0,1,...,n-1}; and (ii) the interval vector
  v = (|s_2-s_1|, |s_3-s_2|, ... |s_n-s_{n-1}|) is a permutation of
  Z_n-{0} = {1,2,...,n-1}. A vector v satisfying these conditions is
  called an all-interval series of size n; the problem of finding such
  a series is the all-interval series problem of size n. We may also be
  interested in finding all possible series of a given size.
