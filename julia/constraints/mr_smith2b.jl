  Mr Smith problem in Julia ConstraintSolver.jl 

  From an IF Prolog example (http://www.ifcomputer.de/)
  """
  The Smith family and their three children want to pay a visit but they
  do not all have the time to do so. Following are few hints who will go
  and who will not:
      o If Mr Smith comes, his wife will come too.
      o At least one of their two sons Matt and John will come.
      o Either Mrs Smith or Tim will come, but not both.
      o Either Tim and John will come, or neither will come.
      o If Matt comes, then John and his father will
        also come.
  """

  The answer should be:
    Mr_Smith_comes      =  0
    Mrs_Smith_comes     =  0
    Matt_comes          =  0
    John_comes          =  1
    Tim_comes           =  1

  This version use more && and ||.
