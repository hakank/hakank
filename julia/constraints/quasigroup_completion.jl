  """
  Using only the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, arrange four sets of these
  numbers into a four-by-four array so that no column or row contains
  the same two numbers. The result is known as a Latin square.
  ...
  The so-called quasigroup completion problem concerns a table that is
  correctly but only partially filled in. The question is whether the
  remaining blanks in the table can be filled in to obtain a complete
  Latin square (or a proper quasigroup multiplication table).
