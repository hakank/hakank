  Euler problem 46 in SICStus Prolog

  """  
  It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be 
  written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

  9 = 7 + 2×1^2
  15 = 7 + 2×2^2
  21 = 3 + 2×3^2
  25 = 7 + 2×3^2
  27 = 19 + 2×2^2
  33 = 31 + 2×1^2

  It turns out that the conjecture was false.

  What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the 
  sum of a prime and twice a square?
