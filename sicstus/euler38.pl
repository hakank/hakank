/*

  Euler problem 38 in SICStus Prolog

  """
  Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

      192 × 1 = 192
      192 × 2 = 384
      192 × 3 = 576

  By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 
  192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 
  and (1,2,3)

  The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 
  1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the 
  concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

  What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be 
  formed as the concatenated product of an integer with 
  (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?
