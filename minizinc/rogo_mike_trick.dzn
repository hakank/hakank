% LazyFD gives the following solution in 1.1 second:
%
% points = [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]);
% sum_points = 8;
% x = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2]);
% y = [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3]);
% 
% Which is correct, though not exactly the same as the 
% one at Mike Tricks blog post:
% Instead of turning from 4,3 -> 4,2 -> 3,2
% this takes              4,3 -> 3,3 -> 3,2
% 
% This has 48 solutions with symmetries;
% 4 when the path symmetry is removed.
