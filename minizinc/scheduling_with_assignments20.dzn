% Grilling hamburgers problem.

% Let's say we need to cook some hamburgers on a barbecue.
% Each hamburger has two sides (just in case there was any doubt!), 
% and each side takes 5 minutes to cook. Only one side of the hamburger 
% can be cooked at a time (no "George Foreman" appliances here). 
% Our barbecue is small, and only has two grills to cook the hamburgers 
% [...].
% 
% Let's say we have three hamburgers to cook. The goal is to cook all of
% the hamburgers in the shortest possible time. Simple, right? Because I am so
% nice (or maybe not, as you shall see later), I am going to give you a solution
% to the problem:
%
%         5  10  15  20
%    G1  H1  H1  H3  H3
%    H2  H2  H2
% 
% [...] There are two rows: one for each grill (appropriately called 
% G1 and G2). The columns show the cooking time in minutes. The 
% table shows when each hamburger is cooking on each grill. Each 
% hamburger has the name H1, H2 and H3. The names must appear twice 
% because each hamburger must be cooked on two sides. Since 
% we cannot cook both sides of a hamburger at the same time, a hamburger
% cannot appear twice in the same column. My solution shows a total cooking
% time of 20 minutes. Can you do better?
