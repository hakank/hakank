  What is the color of the taxi?

  From https://www.bayesia.com/2018-03-02-probabilistic-reasoning-under-uncertainty

  Originally from Kahnemann, Slovic, Tversky "Judgement under uncertainty"
  

  There has been an accicent involving a taxi.
  There are two kinds of taxis:
    - yellow taxi: 85% 
    - white taxi: 15%

  A witness say: It was a white taxi involved in the accident.

  Researcher:
    - 80% of all witness statements are true
    - 20% of all witness statements are false.

  What is the probability that it was a white taxi involved in
  the accident?

  Answer: The probability that it was a white taxi involved in the accident
          is about 41%. And it's the same as in the talk.
  
  This model:
  Marginals:
  involved
  Marginal:
    "yellow" : 0.5862068965517241
    "white" : 0.4137931034482758
  witness_white
  Marginal:
    false : 0.5517241379310345
    true : 0.4482758620689656
  witness_yellow
  Marginal:
    true : 0.5517241379310346
    false : 0.44827586206896547
