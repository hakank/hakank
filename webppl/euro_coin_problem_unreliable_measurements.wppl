   The Euro coin problem.

   From Think Bayes, page 33ff
   """
   A statistical statement appeared in "The Guardian" on Friday January 4, 2002:
      When spun on edge 250 times, a Belgian one-euro coin
      came up heads 140 times and tails 110. 'It looks very
      suspicious to me,' said Barry Blight, a statistics lecturer
      at the London School of Economics. 'If the coin were
      unbiased, the chance of getting a result as extreme as
      that would be less than 7%.'
   But do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair?
   """
 
   Continues on page 41:
   """
   Exercise 4.1. Suppose that instead of observing coin tosses directly, you measure
   the outcome using an instrument that is not always correct. Specifically, suppose
   there is a probability y that an actual heads is reported as tails, or actual tails re-
   ported as heads.

   Write a class that estimates the bias of a coin given a series of outcomes and the
   value of y .
   How does the spread of the posterior distribution depend on y ?
