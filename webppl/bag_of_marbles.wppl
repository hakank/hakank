  Mike has a bag of marbles with 4 white, 8 blue, and
  6 red marbles. He pulls out one marble from the bag
  and it is red. What is the probability that the
  second marble he pulls out of the bag is white?

  The answer is 0.234931.

  This webppl model as well as the cplint and the PSI models give a slightly different
  answer: 0.2352941176470588

     ~/psi/bag_of_marbles.psi

  Also see bag_of_marbles2.wppl for an alternative approach (using recursion as the BLOG model).
