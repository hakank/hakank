  Here is another example of hypothesis testing, this one taken from CliffsQuickReview Statistics
  p. 80, example 5: “A professor wants to know if her introductory statistics class has a good grasp
  of basic math. Six students are chosen at random from the class and given a math proficiency
  test. The professor wants the class to be able to score at least 70 on the test. The six students get
  scores of 62 92 75 68 83 95. Can the professor be at least 90 percent certain that the mean score
  for the class on the test would be at least 70?”

  probability: 0.0304
