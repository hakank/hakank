% Description:   By using Mediterranean fruit flies, Gompertz's 1825 theory that mortality rates increase at an exponential rate as age increases is examined. (i.e. as an organism gets older, its chance of dying per unit of time increase exponentially.)  1,203,646 fruit flies comprised the population for this experiment and the number of flies found dead each day was recorded. Hence, the data consist of the number of surviving flies on each day, up until day 171 when the last two flies died.
% Number of cases:   173
% Variable Names:

% day:   day number
% living:   Number of medflies alive at the beginning of the day
% mort.rate:   Mortality rate for the flies for each day
