'''
Every year, millions of brides (not to mention their mothers, future 
mothers-in-law, and occasionally grooms) struggle with one of the 
most daunting tasks during the wedding-planning process: the 
seating chart. The guest responses are in, banquet hall is booked, 
menu choices have been made. You think the hard parts are over, 
but you have yet to embark upon the biggest headache of them all. 
In order to make this process easier, we present a mathematical 
formulation that models the seating chart problem. This model can 
be solved to find the optimal arrangement of guests at tables. 
At the very least, it can provide a starting point and hopefully 
minimize stress and argumentsâ€¦ 
'''

Here is an optimal solution of problem3:

  problem problem3
  max_num_tables: 5 max_at_table: 10 min_knows_at_table: 3 num_guests: 17
  opt_type: maximize
  tables: [0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 3 1 1 1 4 2 2 2 2]
  z: 273
  
  Table: 0
  ********************
  Deb        mother of the bride
  John       father of the bride
  Allan      grandfather of the bride
  Lois       wife of Allan (the grandfather of the bride)
  table_points: 104
  
  Table: 1
  ********************
  Mary Helen mother of the groom
  Lee        father of the groom
  Annika     sister of the groom
  table_points: 52
  
  Table: 2
  ********************
  Colin      brother of the groom
  Shirley    grandmother of the groom
