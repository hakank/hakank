Five statements problem in cpmpy.

From 
'Puzzle: Joyner' five statements'
http://strathmaths.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/puzzle-joyners-five-statements/
'''
The following little logical teaser appears as 'Ponderable 1.1.3' in 
David Joyner's book Adventures in Group Theory (Johns Hopkins University 
Press, 2008; also available to download for free).

Determine which of the following statements is true.

 - Exactly one of these statements is false.
 - Exactly two of these statements are false.
 - Exactly three of these statements are false.
 - Exactly four of these statements are false.
 - Exactly five of these statements are false.

(Enthusiasts might like to consider the 'natural' generalisation to n statements, 
and in particular the case n=1..) Thanks to Dr AndrÃ© Sonnet for pointing this 
one out to me!
