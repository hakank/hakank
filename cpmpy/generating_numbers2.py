'Generating Numbers' Puzzle

I have come across the following puzzle and couldn't formulate a solution in Picat:

    You will generate 5-digit numbers, where each digit is in 1..5 and 
    different from the others, with the constraint that any three adjacent 
    digits used in one number canâ€™t be used in another number. How many 
    different numbers can be obtained according to this rule?

For example, if we generated the number 23145, the next numbers cannot 
contain 231, 314, or 145.

I got really confused on how to store these "forbidden" sublists and how to 
check each number against them as I build the list of numbers.
'''

In my StackOverflow answer, there are a lot of errors and misguided 
approaches.

A thought about this:
    * There are 60 possible triplets and each number contains
        3 triplets: 60 / 3 = 20!

    * So my conjecture is that the maximum length is 20.
        Let's search for such a sequence. 

    * And one should rather talk about a set of numbers since the
        order is of no importance.

This model finds a solution is 0.06s (1s runtime). Here's the first solution:
