Enigma 1224 - Age-changing in cpmpy.

'''
From New Scientist #2380, 1st February 2003

    If you start with my age, in years, and apply the four operations:

    [  
       +2  /8 

       -3  *7

    ]

    in some order, then the final answer you get is my husbandâ€™s age in years.

    Funnily enough, if you start with his age and apply the same four operations in a 
    different order, then you get my age.

    What are our two ages?
'''

There are two solutions:

    m: 53 h: 48
    hlist: [53, 371, 368, 46, 48]
    mlist: [48, 6, 8, 56, 53]
    perm1: ['*7', '-3', '/8', '+2']
    perm2: ['/8', '+2', '*7', '-3']

    m: 48 h: 53
    hlist: [48, 6, 8, 56, 53]
    mlist: [53, 371, 368, 46, 48]
    perm1: ['/8', '+2', '*7', '-3']
    perm2: ['*7', '-3', '/8', '+2']

However, if we add the constraint that m < h then there's only one
solution, the latter.
