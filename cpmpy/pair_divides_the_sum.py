Here is a puzzle which I found surprisingly easy to program Prolog to
generate solutions to.  If any of you teach Prolog to students, you
might use it as an example (like the goat-wolf-cabbage thing).

Find a set of four distinct positive integers such that, for every pair
of them, their difference divides their sum.

Find lots of such sets.

As above, but sets of five distinct positive integers.

As above, but sets of six ...
