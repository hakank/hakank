/*

  String pattern matching in Pop-11.

  This program reads a word list and tests patterns of
  consecutive characters, e.g. [== a == b == c ==].

  It uses the strmatches library from:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/auto/strmatches.p
  with the elp file here:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/help/strmatches
  Note that it is not included in the standard distribution.

  Compare with
     http://www.hakank.org/poplog/read_test.p 
  which uses regular expressions and includes some results.

  Note that this version is slower than the regular expression
  variant. For the word list /usr/dicts/words (on Linux) and n=5
   * read_test.p take about 6 seconds
   * read_test_strmatches.p takes about 26 seconds.


  This Pop-11 program was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com).
