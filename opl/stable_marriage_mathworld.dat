   In the rankings illustrated above, the male-optimal stable 
   marriage is 
       4, 2, 6, 5, 3, 1, 7, 9, 8, 
   and the female-optimal stable marriage is 
       1, 2, 8, 9, 3, 4, 7, 6, 5. 
   A stable marriage can be found using StableMarriage[m, w] in the 
   Mathematica package Combinatorica` (which can be loaded with the 
   command <<Combinatorica`)
