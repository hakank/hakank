# Problem description
# Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c#, d, ...), represented by numbers 0,1,...,11, this
# problem amounts to find a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly once and in which the
# musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second
# (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones). That is, for each of the intervals, there is a
# pair of neighboring pitch-classes in the series, between which this interval appears.
#
# We consider a generalization of this problem in which the set of numbers is the range from 0 to n-1,
# for any given positive 'n'. In particular, given such 'n', the problem amounts to find a vector
#   s = (s1, ..., sn)
# that is a permutation of {0, 1,..., n-1} and such that the interval vector
#   v = (|s2 - s1|, |s3 - s2|, ..., |sn - s(n-1)|)
# is a permutation of {1, 2,..., n-1}.
#
# Problem input
# * n, the number of pitch classes 
#
# Search space
# The set of permutations of integer range [0..n-1]
#
# Constraints
# * C1: Each pitch class occurs exactly once
# * C2: Differences between neighbouring notes are all different
