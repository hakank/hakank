# Tim and Keri have a full day ahead for themselves as they plan to see 
# and hear everything at Tunapalooza '98, the annual save-the-tuna benefit 
# concert in their hometown. To cover the most ground, they will have to 
# split up. They have arranged to meet during four rock band acts 
# (Ellyfish, Korrupt, Retread Ed and the Flat Tires, and Yellow Reef) at 
# planned rendezvous points (carnival games, information booth, mosh pit, 
# or T-shirt vendor). Can you help match each band name with the type of 
# music they play (country, grunge, reggae, or speed metal) and Tim and 
# Kerri's prearranged meeting spot while they play?
# 
# 1. Korrupt isn't a country or grunge music band.
# 2. Tim and Kerri won't meet at the carnival games during Ellyfish's 
#    performance.
# 3. The pair won't meet at the T-shirt vendor during the reggae band's show.
# 4. Exactly two of the following three statements are true:
# a) Ellyfish plays grunge music.
# b) Tim and Kerri won't meet at the information booth during a 
#    performance by Retread Ed and the Flat Tires.
# c) The two friends won't meet at the T-shirt vendor while Yellow Reef is playing.
# 5. The country and speed metal acts are, in some order, Retread Ed 
#    and the Flat Tires and the act during which Tim and Kerri will 
#    meet at the mosh pit.
# 6. The reggae band is neither Korrupt nor the act during which Tim and 
#    Kerri will meet at the information booth.
# 
# Determine: Band name -- Music type -- Meeting place
