# Secret Santa problem II in Z3

# From Maple Primes: "Secret Santa Graph Theory"

# """
# Every year my extended family does a "secret santa" gift exchange. 
# Each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for 
# them. At first, none of my siblings were married, and so the draw was 
# completely random. Then, as people got married, we added the restriction 
# that spouses should not draw each others names. This restriction meant 
# that we moved from using slips of paper on a hat to using a simple 
# computer program to choose names. Then people began to complain when 
# they would get the same person two years in a row, so the program was 
# modified to keep some history and avoid giving anyone a name in their 
# recent history. This year, not everyone was participating, and so after 
# removing names, and limiting the number of exclusions to four per person, 
# I had data something like this:
# 
# Name: Spouse, Recent Picks
# 
# Noah: Ava. Ella, Evan, Ryan, John
# Ava: Noah, Evan, Mia, John, Ryan
# Ryan: Mia, Ella, Ava, Lily, Evan
# Mia: Ryan, Ava, Ella, Lily, Evan
# Ella: John, Lily, Evan, Mia, Ava
# John: Ella, Noah, Lily, Ryan, Ava
# Lily: Evan, John, Mia, Ava, Ella
# Evan: Lily, Mia, John, Ryan, Noah
# """
# 
# Note: I interpret this as the following three constraints:
#   1) One cannot be a Secret Santa of one's spouse
#   2) One cannot be a Secret Santa for somebody two years in a row
#   3) Optimization: maximize the time since the last time 
#
# This model also handle single persons, something the original
# problem don't mention.
