# When the Sunny Hills Country Club golf course isn't in use by club members,
# of course, it's open to the club's employees. Recently, Jack and three other
# workers at the golf course got together on their day off to play a round of
# eighteen holes of golf.
# Afterward, all four, including Mr. Green, went to the clubhouse to total
# their scorecards. Each man works at a different job (one is a short-order
# cook), and each shot a different score in the game. No one scored below
# 70 or above 85 strokes. From the clues below, can you discover each man's
# full name, job and golf score?
#
# 1. Bill, who is not the maintenance man, plays golf often and had the lowest
# score of the foursome.
# 2. Mr. Clubb, who isn't Paul, hit several balls into the woods and scored ten
# strokes more than the pro-shop clerk.
# 3. In some order, Frank and the caddy scored four and seven more strokes than
# Mr. Sands.
# 4. Mr. Carter thought his score of 78 was one of his better games, even
#    though Frank's score  was lower.
# 5. None of the four scored exactly 81 strokes.
#
# Determine: First Name - Last Name - Job - Score
