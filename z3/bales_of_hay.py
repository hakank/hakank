# Bales of hay problem in Z3

# From The Math Less Traveled, 
# "The haybaler", http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/?p=582 
# """
# You have five bales of hay.
#
# For some reason, instead of being weighed individually, they were weighed 
# in all possible combinations of two. The weights of each of these 
# combinations were written down and arranged in numerical order, without 
# keeping track of which weight matched which pair of bales. The weights, 
# in kilograms, were 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, and 91.
#
# How much does each bale weigh? Is there a solution? Are there multiple 
# possible solutions?
