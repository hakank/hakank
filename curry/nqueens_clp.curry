  N-queens problem in Curry CLP.FD

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
  ""
  The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so 
  that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the 
  same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions.
  """

  This is a port of my Picat model http://hakank.org/picat/queens.pi

  Note: using the allDifferent constraint for the two 'other' constraints 
  yield TODO: Show CLP.FD.FDExpr.

  However, using a decomposition (HakankUtilsCLPFD.allDifferent2) works.

  This program was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@gmail.com)
