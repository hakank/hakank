"""
  Simple regular expression in OR-tools CP-SAT Solver.

  My last name (Kjellerstrand) is quite often misspelled
  in ways that this regular expression shows:
    k(je|채)ll(er|ar)?(st|b)r?an?d

  This model generates all the words that can be construed
  by this regular expression.

  Compared to regexp_sat.py, this model use AddAutomaton
  instead of the slower decomposition of the MiniZinc style
  regular constraint.

  This model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand (hakank@bonetmail.com)
  Also see my other OR-tools models: http://www.hakank.org/or_tools/
